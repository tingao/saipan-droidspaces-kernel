#   * it leaves the APK on the system partition, so a mistake cannot leave the
#     handset without a component it needs to boot;
#   * unlike `pm uninstall --user 0` it survives a wipe of the user data.
# Every action is written to a rollback script, printed at the end, so the whole

# --- packages this ROM refuses to disable ------------------------------------

# `pm disable-user` and `pm uninstall --user 0` both fail with "package is
# non-disable", `com.motorola.paks` says "package is protected", and `pm hide`
# reports "new hidden state: false" without sticking. The package cannot be
# removed from here, but it can be stopped from running in the background, which
# is the part that costs anything on a headless device.
#
# This matters most for the two OTA updaters: an over-the-air update on an
# unlocked bootloader with a custom kernel is how the device gets bricked.
